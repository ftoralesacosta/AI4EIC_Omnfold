This Repository is an ominfold meant to walk through the steps of using Omnifold for unfolding in the [AI4EIC](https://indico.bnl.gov/event/16586/).

Many thanks to Miguel Arratia, Owen Long, and Daniel Britzger for letting us use their data from this awesome [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05505.pdf) on reconstructing DIS events using Deep Learning.

Many thanks to Ben Nachman. The template of this tutorial is taken from his [repo](https://github.com/hep-lbdl/OmniFold) on Omnifold, and is of coursed based on this really cool [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09107).
